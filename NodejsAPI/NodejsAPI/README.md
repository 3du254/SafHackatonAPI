1. Create a scratch card record. 
   Note that the voucher number should be unique and randomly generated by an algorithm only known to Safaricom.
   This algorithm should generate only numbers. The algorithm should not be reversible. 
   Assume you pass a combination of numbers  or words to achieve this (it’s your choice).
	#URL http://localhost:9000/scratchCards == METHOD POST
	
	JSON:{

                

                "SerialNumber": "11",

                "ExpiryDate": "2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",

                "VoucherAmount": 100000               

                
           }

2. Fetch all records inserted in the last 3 minutes regardless of whether they are expired or not.
	#URL http://localhost:9000/newScratchCards == METHOD GET
 
3. Fetch a scratch card record by the serial number. 
	#URL http://localhost:9000/scratchCards/{serialNumber} == METHOD GET

4.  A function to change the status of all active records to inactive, which have not been taken. Assume a record expires after 5 minutes by default. 
  This value should be configurable. 
  Every 5 minutes if you query for the scratch card record which has not been taken it’s not available.
	#URL http://localhost:9000/updateExpiredScratchCard == METHOD PUT
  
5. Delete all inactive records.
	#URL http://localhost:9000/scratchCards == METHOD DELETE
 
6. Update scratch card info( Only allow the status to be updated).
  (assuming a person requests for a scratch card then the status will change to taken). 
	#URL http://localhost:9000/updateScratchCardStatus == METHOD PUT
